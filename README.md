# CODE-CHALLANGE-1
# Grade Calculation Program

This is a simple JavaScript program that calculates grades based on the marks provided.

## Usage

1. Open the program in a JavaScript-enabled environment (e.g., a web browser console).
2. When prompted, enter your marks.
3. The program will calculate and display your corresponding grade.

## How It Works

The program takes the input marks and applies a set of rules to determine the grade. Here's a brief overview of the grading criteria:

- Marks above 80: Grade A
- Marks between 60 and 79 : Grade B
- Marks between 50 and 59 : Grade C
- Marks between 40 and 49 : Grade D
- Marks 39 or below: Grade E

Note: The program assumes the input marks are numeric.

## Example

Suppose you input marks as 75. The program will output the following:THIS IS YOUR GRADE B
